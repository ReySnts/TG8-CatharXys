  <Description>k__BackingField: A hound with the wings of an eagle, seems to always
    be set on fire, proportionate to its size. It is unknown where it came from as
    multiple attempts of discovery leads to disappointing results that usually also
    claims personnel lives. The one we captured was the only one we had and it cost
